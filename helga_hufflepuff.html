                        <b>Helga Hufflepuff</b> (fl. c. 993) was an English wizard and one of the four founders of
                        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was great friends with Salazar Slytherin, but
                        opposed him when he
                        later thought that they should not accept Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. It is unknown when
                        he
                        died. In his honour Gryffindor's birthplace became known as Godric's Hollow. Godric Gryffindor's
                        portrait
                        still remains at Hogwarts.

                    Gryffindor hailed from a moor which is now known as Godric's Hollow, a small West Country village
                    in England. He was described as being "the best duellist of his time".

                    <h4>Hogwarts Founder</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        <i>By Gryffindor, the bravest were prized far beyond the rest.</i><br>
                        — Sorting Hat regarding Gryffindor
                    </blockquote>
                    Said to be one of "the four most brilliant witches and wizards of the time"[3], Godric Gryffindor
                    founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his adulthood, with friends Salazar Slytherin,
                    Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw, though he later severed ties with Slytherin. He even appears
                    to have carefully selected members of his own House.<br><br>
                    Gryffindor is said to have praised courage, determination and strength of heart above all other
                    qualities. Indeed, he selected students for his house based upon their daring and bravery, according
                    to the Sorting Hat. He also was the most in favour of allowing Muggle-borns into the school.<br><br>
                    The founders, however, were unsure of how they would Sort the students when they were dead. To solve
                    this, Gryffindor took off his hat and all four of them enchanted it so that it could sort the
                    students long after their deaths. It was, from then on, known as the Sorting Hat.<br><br>
                    Gryffindor was initially a close friend of Salazar Slytherin, but over time their friendship
                    deteriorated. After a number of years of working peacefully together, Slytherin eventually grew
                    apart from his fellow founders due to his distrust of Muggle-borns, and his belief that they should
                    not be accepted into Hogwarts. When Slytherin failed to convince Gryffindor and the others to accept
                    his ideas, he chose to leave the school. Unbeknownst to Gryffindor, his former friend built a hidden
                    chamber within the castle, in which he hid a basilisk that his heir would later use to try and purge
                    the school of Muggle-borns.<br><br>
                    It is unknown how or when Gryffindor died, though he left an enduring legacy.
                    </p><br>

                    <h4>Post-Mortem</h4>
                    A portrait of Gryffindor hung at Hogwarts Castle guarded a secret short cut between the
                    seventh-floor landing of the Grand Staircase and the Entrance Hall side room. The password required
                    to gain access to said shortcut was Starshine.[8] Gryffindor left two known relics: a goblin-made
                    sword, adorned with rubies, and the Sorting Hat. The two items share a particular bond; whenever a
                    "true Gryffindor" needs it, the Sword will let itself be pulled out of the hat. Godric's sword was
                    capable of acquiring powers from those it had slain and thus was imbued with venom from Harry
                    Potter's defeat of the Basilisk, making it suitable as a tool for destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes.
                    Albus Dumbledore used it to destroy Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, Ron Weasley used it to eliminate Salazar
                    Slytherin's Locket, and Neville Longbottom used it to kill Nagini, the final Horcrux.

                    <hr>
                    Godric Gryffindor's portrait depicts him as a tall, muscular man with a lion-like mane of wavy red
                    hair and a beard to match. He had green eyes, peach-coloured skin and is often shown with his famous
                    sword, with which he had great skill in wielding.<br><br>
                    He has also been shown as wearing segmented red sword gauntlets adorned with gold fittings that are
                    often depicted as being rather worn and burned-looking. He is also shown as wearing magnificent red
                    robes with gold highlights and rather intricate designs on the sleeves. He is also frequently
                    depicted with a rather powerful and stern gaze.<br><br>

                    <h2>Personality & Traits</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Godric Gryffindor valued courage, determination, chivalry, and strength of heart, and was described
                    as one of the four most brilliant witches and wizards of his time. He was also the most tolerant and
                    accepting of Muggle-borns out of the Founders, a point which brought about the end of his friendship
                    with Salazar Slytherin. He was very forward thinking due to his creating the Sorting Hat to preserve
                    the selection of the students after his time. This showcases his cleverness and creativity.<br><br>
                    He also had a versatile mindset as he chose to wield a sword as well as a wand, making him a rather
                    dynamic man who deferred to the duelling style of his opponent, muggle and wizard alike. Going along
                    with this, it shows that he was respectful and fair, choosing to wield a sword instead of magic
                    against muggle combatants out of a sense of fair play as magic would be a most decidedly unbalanced
                    weapon in a duel against a simple sword. In addition to showing his sense of fairness, his deference
                    to the duelling style of opponent also shows a need to challenge himself, proving his worth and
                    courage, which became one of the signature traits of his House at Hogwarts.<br><br>
                    His threat to unsheathe and use his famous blade against Ragnuk the First and his followers shows
                    that despite his noble heart and good intentions, that Godric was very much capable of taking the
                    lives of sapient beings such as Goblins. This would not have been an uncommon trait for a man of his
                    era or personality due to the constant violence that pervaded medieval Europe and the acceptability
                    of duelling to the death among both wizard and muggles alike.<br><br>

                            his sword in combat. His skill as a swordsman was such that he preferred to duel muggles
                            with his sword instead of his magic, despite magic being the more decisive and powerful
                            weapon.[9]

                            lifetime, with the help of the other founders. He was also capable of producing a

                            The name Godric is an Anglo-Saxon name in form, and can have several meanings, including,
                            "he who rules with God" or "he who rules well".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            His surname is a reference to the half-lion magical beast, the Griffin, a fierce, legendary
                            beast with the body of a lion, and the head and wings of an eagle. The Hogwarts house named
                            after him uses a lion as its symbol. Furthermore, the last part of his surname, "dor", is
                            similar to both the French d'or, "made from gold", "golden", which is one of the colours of
                            his Hogwarts House, or the suffix dore, which means "gift of," in which case the meaning of
                            "Gryffindor" would be "gift of the Gryffin."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gryffindor is also a pun on the golden griffin, which is a lion that only has eagle wings,

                            French for Griffindor, Griffondor is a French homophone for the actual beast, Griffon d'Or.

                            Godric Gryffindor was named the July 2007 "Wizard of the Month" on Rowling's website. "One
                            of the four famous founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Godric Gryffindor
                            was the most accomplished dueller of his time, an enlightened fighter against
                            Muggle-discrimination and the first owner of the celebrated Sorting Hat."

                            J.K. Rowling once jokingly stated that if Godric Gryffindor was still alive: he would be the
                            Giant Squid that lives in Hogwarts lake, that would make him the biggest Animagus (and,
                            quite possibly, the oldest) in the Wizarding world. At the eleventh hour of each night the
                            squid would change back into Gryffindor, who would wander the school grounds before
                            returning to his squid form. It should be noted that Rowling was sarcastically trying to
                            make a point, so obviously this statement is not considered canon.

                            Godric Gryffindor is the only founder who is not mentioned to have any descendants, although
                            for a time it was speculated that Harry Potter himself was a descendant of Gryffindor either
                            through James Potter possibly because James hailed from Godric's hometown, or possibly
                            through a line of Squibs to James' wife Lily Evans. However, this theory was later debunked
                            by J. K. Rowling in an interview.

                            Gryffindor appears in the queue of the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride inside of
                            The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at both Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios
                            Hollywood as a portrait.

                            On the official website of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Godric mentions that he is
                            proud to have Harry Potter in his house and calls him "A remarkable young man".

                            Gryffindor's name and birthplace may allude to the Hardy Boys story "The Witchmaster's Key",
                            which references the fictional village of Gruffinmoor.

                            The real-world Gryffindor family name is apparently of Welsh origin, although it spread to
                            Ireland in the 12th century.

                            A new species of spider was named after Gryffindor, Eriovixia gryffindori. The name was
                            chosen due to the spider's triangular body's resemblance to the Sorting Hat, of which
                            Gryffindor was the first owner.
